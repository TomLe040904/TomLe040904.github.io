For the whole lesson, I learned with a new classmate, his name is Long. Particularly, the main topic that I learned was an overview of Introduction to Science and Technology. In this topic, I learned about the bachelor of IT and Engineering, the information about the course, and program support sources. I started to work with Long to introduce myself and get to know each other, even though he learned AI, we planned to cooperate on the presentation assignment and we worked together to help us to share experiences of IT. I felt it was quite difficult to consolidate all the details information of the course as I sit much far away from the lecturer and was not confident that I could listen not good enough to actively understand the lesson. <img data-src="/assets/images/Image-1.png" alt="Picture" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>On the positive side, my partner was ready to help me to understand the lesson and guide me in the vocabulary that gets to the main point. On the negative side, I could not contribute my ideas to actively participate during class activities and I sit too far away from the lecturer to help myself feel confident in my listening and group work skills. The introduction to science and technology lesson was fun because I met a new lecturer and classmates. Also, Konopka <a href="#3">[3]</a> concludes that the main purpose of teamwork is cooperation and experience through a think pair share activity, I have learned from others creative thinking, diverse vocabulary skills, and programming experience. <img data-src="/assets/images/Image-2.png" alt="Picture" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>As the result, I could learn about the foundations of science and technology through the slides from the projector and the schoolâ€™s iMac. I also learned about avoiding plagiarism while writing journals for the assignment. Also, I built up group work skills while working with my partner in AI programming by sharing his experience and realizing that it was no problem to be shy. The next time I talk with other classmates and listen to the lecturer, I will get better at listening skills in the next lesson and talking with classmates in one week by completing the meetings, self-study the foundations of programming twice a day, and practicing for coding and participating in a group starting one of the weeks in advance.

Unfortunately, I was recovering from my illness, and I decided to learn online through Teams and I could not work with any classmates. Mainly, I learned an overview of a research paper along with the outline and structure, Tullu <a href="#4">[4]</a> states that planning a research paper concluded induction and deduction, and the methods of data collection. I tried to hear the lecturer while he was teaching us about the research paper and preparing and noting the information for the next research paper. I felt it was difficult to consolidate all the details information of the course as I studied online and was not confident I could listen not good enough to understand the lesson. However, I tried to help myself to understand the lecturer while instructing the course from Long and I had a meeting after the class to help me understand the lesson effectively, I was open-minded and felt more motivated. My friend offered me some guidance on my listening skills and practicals after the course which assisted me with understanding when I worked with him. <img data-src="/assets/images/Image-4.jpg" alt="Picture" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>On the positive side, my partner was ready to help me to understand the lesson and guide me in the vocabulary that gets to the main point. Also, Mr. Jonathan was devoted to helping us with the next assignment. On the negative side, I could not hear the lecturerâ€™s sermon to take notes. On reflection, I realized that I should come to the class, face-to-face lesson to hear the lecturer consolidate the lesson. The main purpose of teamwork is cooperation and experience through working as a group. <img data-src="/assets/images/Image-5.jpg" alt="Picture" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>As the result, I could learn about the structure and planning of an outline of a research paper through the slides.

The next time I studied online, I will get better at listening skills in the next lesson in one week by completing the meetings, self-study grammar twice a day, and participating in a group starting one of the weeks in advance.

Particularly, the topic that I learned was about practicing paraphrased quotes, and synthesis articles. My group started paraphrasing the first quote about the chances of disaster on planet Earth, I used the method of chunking, which meant using the slash sign to separate the quoteâ€™s idea, Fitria <a href="#2">[2]</a> states that students now are always using online tools to rewrite or summarize an article. Then I rewrote the quote in my own words with pens on a sheet of blank paper and compare a specific view of the other groupâ€™s paragraph. I felt it was quite difficult, I rewrote a paragraph from a quote and was not confident that I could write well enough to help my partner. However, my partner tried to get me to understand the quote, then he guided me to paraphrase, I was open-minded and felt more positive. My partners gave me advice on my writing skill during the activity which helped me to understand and improve it when I worked with them although I did worry afterward that my paraphrased paragraph was not as good as other peopleâ€™s. <img data-src="/assets/images/Image-7.jpg" alt="Picture" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>On the positive side, my partners were friendly and ready for any help. On the negative side, I could not paraphrase a paragraph to help my partner while practicing during a class activity. On reflection, I realized that I should practice writing before I went to school. The paraphrasing lesson was fun although I focused on a paraphrased quote. After the class, I spoke to Long and his positive feedback helped me realize that my introverted personality should be improved, and more active. <img data-src="/assets/images/Image-8.jpg" alt="Picture" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>As a result, I could learn about the ways of paraphrasing quotes and got confidence in myself. Also, I built up the compromise while working with my partners and learned about their learning skills in academic writing by paraphrasing quotes from this experience and realizes that it was no problem to be shy. The next time I paraphrase a quote, I will get better at paraphrasing paragraphs in the next research presentation in one week by completing my group project through meetings on time, paraphrasing a paragraph of an article at least twice a day, and writing starting half of the week in advance. This will help me feel better organized and confident in academic writing of paraphrasing. <img data-src="/assets/images/Image-9.jpg" alt="Picture" data-proofer-ignore></p><hr /><h1 id="reflective-blog-entry-4"><center>REFLECTIVE BLOG ENTRY #4</center></h1><h2 id="reflection-on-online-lesson-on-effective-oral-communication"><span class="mr-2"><center>Reflection on Online Lesson on Effective Oral Communication</center></span><a href="#reflection-on-online-lesson-on-effective-oral-communication" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>For the whole lesson on Monday, I learned with my lecturer, his name is Mr. Peter. The topic that I learned was about practicing oral communication skills when working as a group. Group communication was the main lesson. My group started thinking about the purpose of the presentations; we tried to contribute our ideas online because Long and I were staying at home. While contributing some ideas, I felt it was quite difficult as I talked with a new student and was not confident I could have ideas to help my partner when working in a group. My partners gave me advice on my communication skill during the activity which helped me to understand and improve them. <img data-src="/assets/images/Image-10.jpg" alt="Picture" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>On the positive side, my partners and I worked together to have ideas. On the negative side, I did not contribute my thoughts about the purpose of the presentations. On reflection, I realized that I could see the next slide to have some ideas to work on. The oral communication lesson was fun although I focused on other works, which was not the primary purpose of our group throughout the lesson. DiPeri <a href="#1">[1]</a> states that students must stay focused and listen to others while working with a group to have more ideas to contribute and communicate with each other. I spoke to a Korean friend and her positive feedback helped me realize that my introverted personality should be improved, and more active, which allowed my partner to feel comfortable and confident in working in a group. Also, the primary purpose of teamwork is cooperation and experiences through improving effective communication. <img data-src="/assets/images/Image-11.jpg" alt="Picture" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>As the result, I could improve my communication when working in a group and got confidence in myself then contributed my ideas to my partners. Also, I built up the compromise while working with my partners and learned about their learning skills in effective oral communication and I realized that it was no problem to be shy when talking with classmates. The next time I work with group members, I will get better at communication in the next group research presentation in one week by completing my group project through meetings on time, talking with my partners at least twice a day to prepare our group presentation, and communicating about the presentation on AI topics half of the week in advance. This will help me feel better organized and confident in oral communication. <img data-src="/assets/images/Image-12.jpg" alt="Picture" data-proofer-ignore></p><hr /><h1 id="action-plan-for-the-four-blog-entries"><center>ACTION PLAN FOR THE FOUR BLOG ENTRIES</center></h1><h2 id="an-overview-of-experiences-at-the-school-of-science-and-technology"><span class="mr-2"><center>An Overview of Experiences at the School of Science and Technology</center></span><a href="#an-overview-of-experiences-at-the-school-of-science-and-technology" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>After more than four weeks that I studied at the school of science and technology at RMIT university, I could have experience in improving my self-study skills, having effective communication with my classmates and learning from them about group working and making new friends discussing programming jobs. The experiences that I have learned from Long and other classmates in the class were open to the world of technology, I could gain more and more expertise in specific fields while studying RMITâ€™s education program and recognize the uses, benefits and utilities that the technology industry in general or the web designer for industry, data analysis in particular. From that experiences, I could learn about planning the assignment, which means I will try to complete the assignment earlier than the deadline because I need to check it again so that if there is a mistake, there is still time to fix it. Finally, I realized that I should not be lazy, because my house is far away, and I have to attend online classes. One thing is for sure, the quality of online lessons cannot be equal to face-to-face plus being a bit lazy about reviewing the records of the sessions to better understand, I did not watch and missed a lot of knowledge. But I have overcome that by having to spend twice as much time as other friends just to spend from six to seven hours a day looking at from three to four recording videos. It is foolish and inefficient to accumulate large amounts of knowledge for learning, but fortunately, I have evenly distributed the necessary amount of knowledge that I have gleaned by jotting down the main ideas, then setting a goal for myself that one day I will learn according to the amount of knowledge that I have divided in my notes. The next time I study Bachelor of Information Technology program, I will get better at communication for the group working in one week by practicing my pronunciation at home through the Cake app, I will get better at listening skills for the next program in one week by watching and listening to English movies, and I will get better at paraphrasing paragraphs for the next programâ€™s research paper in one week by writing every day. This will help me feel better organized and confident in all the academic skills to prepare for the next program.</p><p><br /> <br /></p><hr /><h3 id="references"><span class="mr-2"><center>References</center></span><a href="#references" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><span id="1">[1]</span> DiPeri, D.
