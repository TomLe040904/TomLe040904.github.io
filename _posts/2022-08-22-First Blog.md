## <center>Reflection on The First Lesson of Science and Technology</center>

<!-- Paragraph 1: Description & Feelings -->
On Thursday, I learned with Mr. Jonathan who was a senior lecturer at RMIT Vietnam. For the whole lesson, I learned with a new classmate, his name is Long. Particularly, the main topic that I learned was an overview of Introduction to Science and Technology. In this topic, I learned about the bachelor of IT and Engineering, the information about the course, and program support sources. I started to work with Long to introduce myself and get to know each other, even though he learned AI, we planned to cooperate on the presentation assignment and we worked together to help us to share experiences of IT. I felt it was quite difficult to consolidate all the details information of the course as I sit much far away from the lecturer and was not confident that I could listen not good enough to actively understand the lesson.

<!-- Paragraph 2: Evaluate & Analysis -->
On the positive side, my partner was ready to help me to understand the lesson and guide me in the vocabulary that gets to the main point. On the negative side, I could not contribute my ideas to actively participate during class activities and I sit too far away from the lecturer to help myself feel confident in my listening and group work skills. The introduction to science and technology lesson was fun because I met a new lecturer and classmates. Also, Konopka (1960) concludes that the main purpose of teamwork is cooperation and experience through a think pair share activity <a href="#1">(1)</a>, I have learned from others creative thinking, diverse vocabulary skills, and programming experience.

<!-- Paragraph 3: Conclusion & Action Plan -->
As the result, I could learn about the foundations of science and technology through the slides from the projector and the school's iMac. I also learned about avoiding plagiarism while writing journals for the assignments. Also, I built up group work skills while working with my partner in AI programming by sharing his experience and realizing that it was no problem to be shy. The next time I talk with other classmates and listen to the lecturer, I will get better at listening skills in the next lesson and talking with classmates in one week by completing the meetings, self-study the foundations of programming twice a day, and practicing for coding and participating in a group starting one of the weeks in advance. This will help me be confident in the introduction to science and technology course in future assignments.
