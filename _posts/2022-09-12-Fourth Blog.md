## <center>Reflection on Online Lesson on Effective Oral Communication</center>

<!-- Paragraph 1: Description & Feelings -->
For the whole lesson on Monday, I learned with my lecturer, his name is Mr. Peter. The topic that I learned was about practicing oral communication skills when working as a group. Group communication was the main lesson. My group started thinking about the purpose of the presentations; we tried to contribute our ideas online because Long and I were staying at home. While contributing some ideas, I felt it was quite difficult as I talked with a new student and was not confident I could have ideas to help my partner when working in a group. My partners gave me advice on my communication skill during the activity which helped me to understand and improve it.

On the positive side, my partners and I worked together to have ideas. On the negative side, I did not contribute my thoughts about the purpose of the presentations. On reflection, I realized that I could see the next slide to have some ideas to work on. The oral communication lesson was fun although I focused on other works, which was not the primary purpose of our group throughout the lesson. DiPeri states that students must stay focused and listen to others while working with a group to have more ideas to contribute and communicate with each other (DiPeri 2021) <a href="#1">(1)</a>. I spoke to a Korean friend and her positive feedback helped me realize that my introverted personality should be improved, and more active, which allowed my partner to feel comfortable and confident in working in a group. Also, the primary purpose of teamwork is cooperation and experience through effective communication.

As the result, I could improve my communication when working in a group and got confidence in myself then contributed my ideas to my partners. Also, I built up the compromise while working with my partners and learned about their learning skills in effective oral communication and I realized that it was no problem to be shy when talking with classmates. The next time I work with group members, I will get better at communication in the next group research presentation in one week by completing my group project through meetings on time, talking with my partners at least twice a day to prepare our group presentation, and communicating about the presentation on AI topics half of the week in advance. This will help me feel better organized and confident in oral communication.
