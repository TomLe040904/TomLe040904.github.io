## <center>Reflection on Paraphrasing and Summarizing Lesson</center>

<!-- Paragraph 1: Description & Feelings -->
For the whole lesson on Monday, I learned with my guest lecturer, his name was Mr. Peter. Particularly, the topic that I learned was about practicing paraphrased quotes, and synthesis articles. My group started paraphrasing the first quote about the chances of disaster on planet Earth, I used the method of chunking, which meant using the slash sign to separate the quote’s idea, Fitria states that students now are always using online-tools to rewrite or summarize an article (Fitria 2021) <a href="#1">(1)</a>. Then I rewrote the quote in my own words by pens on a sheet of blank paper and compare a specific view of other group’s paragraph. I felt it was quite difficult as I rewrote a paragraph from a quote and was not confident that I could write well enough to help my partner. However, my partners tried to get me to understand the quote, then he guided me to paraphrase, I was open-minded and felt more positive. My partners gave me advice on my writing skill during the activity which helped me to understand and improve it when I worked with them although I did worry afterward that my paraphrased paragraph was not as good as other people's.

On the positive side, my partners were friendly and ready for any help. On the negative side, I could not paraphrase a paragraph to help my partner while practicing during a class activity. On reflection, I realized that I should practice writing before I went to school. The paraphrasing lesson was fun although I focused on a paraphrased quote. After the class, I spoke to Long and his positive feedback helped me realize that my introverted personality should be improved, and more active.

As the result, I could learn about the ways of paraphrasing quotes and got confidence in myself. Also, I built up the compromise while working with my partners and learned about their learning skills in academic writing by paraphrasing quotes from this experience and realizes that it was no problem to be shy. The next time I paraphrase a quote, I will get better at paraphrasing paragraphs in the next research presentation in one week by completing my group project through meetings on time, paraphrasing a paragraph of an article at least twice a day, and writing starting half of the week in advance. This will help me feel better organized and confident in academic writing of paraphrasing.
