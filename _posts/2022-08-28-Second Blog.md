## <center>Reflection on Online Lesson on Science and Technology</center>

<!-- Paragraph 1: Description & Feelings -->
On Thursday, I learned with Mr. Jonathan, a senior lecturer at RMIT Vietnam. Unfortunately, I was recovering from my illness, and I decided to learn online through Teams and I could not work with any classmates. Mainly, I learned an overview of a research paper along with the outline and structure, Tullu (2019) <a href="#1">(1)</a> states that planning a research paper concluded induction and deduction, and the methods of data collection. I tried to hear the lecturer while he was teaching us about the research paper and preparing and noting the information for the next research paper. I felt it was difficult to consolidate all the details information of the course as I studied online and was not confident I could listen not good enough to understand the lesson. However, I tried to help myself to understand the lecturer while instructing the course from Long and I had a meeting after the class to help me understand the lesson effectively, I was open-minded and felt more motivated. My friend offered me guidance on my listening skills and practicals after the course which assisted me with understanding when I worked with him.

<!-- Paragraph 2: Evaluate & Analysis -->
On the positive side, my partner was ready to help me to understand the lesson and guide me in the vocabulary that gets to the main point. Also, Mr. Jonathan was devoted to helping us with the next assignment. On the negative side, I could not hear the lecturer's sermon to take notes. On reflection, I realized that I should come to the class, face-to-face lesson to hear the lecturer consolidate the lesson. The main purpose of teamwork is cooperation and experience through working as a group.

<!-- Paragraph 3: Conclusion & Action Plan -->
As the result, I could learn about the structure and planning of an outline of a research paper through the slides. I also learned about avoiding plagiarism while writing a research paper for the next assignment. Also, I built up group work skills while working with Long and learned about his writing and listening skills by sharing his experience and realizing that I should be in class. The next time I studied online, I will get better at listening skills in the next lesson in one week by completing the meetings, self-study grammar twice a day, and participating in a group starting one of the weeks in advance. This will help me feel better organized and confident in the course of future assignments.
